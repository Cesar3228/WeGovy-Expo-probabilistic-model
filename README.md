# WeGovy-Expo-probabilistic-model
I designed this probabilistic model in order to find out how many people will not be engage in an activity during an expo for a period of an hour and thirty minutes.

The model used the different "attractions" with their respective capacity and duration in order to acomodate all the assistants to the expo.
The model also takes into account 4 different assitance rates, one with 100% assistance, other with 90%, one with 80% and the last one with 70%.

This model was built to see how much budget is needed in other to sum more attractions to the expo and have as little as possible attendees entertain.
The results of the model vary because of some randomess used in order to simulate movement between the attendees but at the end I used a mean of all the results and obtain that around 1500 and 2000
attendees are left with nothing to do in any given time during the timeframe.
